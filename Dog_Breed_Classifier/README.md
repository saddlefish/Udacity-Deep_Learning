Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier
- The purpose of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN). For this project, I had to learn how to build a pipeline to process user-supplied images. Given this use case, it will be an image of a dog where the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. If, however, an image of a human face is provided then the algorithm will attempt to identify the resembling dog breed.
- Project specifications:
  - Develop a dog_dector function that returns True if a dog is detected in an image and False if not. This will be accomplished by using the pre-trained VGG16 Network to find the predicted class for a given image.
  - Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from scratch):
    - Write 3 separate data loaders for training, validation, and test datasets of dog images. These images should be pre-processed to be of the correct size, which will be accomplished using various transform techniques.
    - Choose appropriate loss and optimization functions for this classification task. Train the model for a number of epochs and save the best result.
    - The trained model attains at least 10% accuracy on the test set.
  - Create a CNN Using Transfer Learning:
    - Train the model for a number of epochs and save the result with the lowest validation loss
    - Achieve accuracy on the test set greater or equal to 60%
