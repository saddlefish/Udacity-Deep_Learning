Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
  - The purpose of the project is to build a neural network from scratch to carry out the prediction problem on the dataset. Once completed I'll have a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other neural network properties.
  - The data comes the UCI ML Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
  - Project/Network parameters to adhere to:
    - The activation function should be a sigmoid function
    - The number of epochs should be between 50 and 1500
    - The number of hidden nodes should be between 5 and 100
    - There should be exactly one output node
    - The learning rate should be between 0.05 and 5
    - Produce good results when running the network on the full dataset, with requirements being:
    - Training loss should be less than 0.09
    - Validation loss should be less than 0.18
