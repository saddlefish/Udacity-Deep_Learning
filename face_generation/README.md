Project 5: Generate Faces

  - The purpose of the project is to use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
  - Project Requirements:
    - Data Loading and Processing
      - Has get_dataloader been implemented?
        - The function get_dataloader should transform image data into resized, Tensor image types and return a DataLoader that batches all the training data into an appropriate size
      - Has the scale function been implemented?
        - Pre-process the images by creating a scale function that scales images into a given pixel range. This function should be used later, in the training loop
    - Build the Adversarial Networks
      - Does the discriminator discriminate between real and fake mages?
        - The Discriminator class is implemented correctly; it outputs one value that will determine whether an image is real or fake
      - Does the generator generate fake mages?
        - The Generator class is implemented correctly; it outputs an image of the same shape as the processed training data
      - Is the weight initialization function implemented correctly?
        - This function should initialize the weights of any convolutional or linear layer with weights taken from a normal distribution with a mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.02
    - Optimization Strategy
      - Are the real_loss and fake_loss functions implemented correctly?
        - The loss functions take in the outputs from a discriminator and return the real or fake loss
      - Are appropriate optimizers defined for the networks?
        - There are optimizers for updating the weights of the discriminator and generator. These optimizers should have appropriate hyperparameters.
    - Training and Results
      - Are all adversarial networks trained correctly?
        - Real training images should be scaled appropriately. The training loop should alternate between training the discriminator and generator networks
      - Do all models and optimizers have reasonable hyperparameters?
        - There is not an exact answer here, but the models should be deep enough to recognize facial features and the optimizers should have parameters that help wth model convergence
      - Does the project generate realistic faces?
        - The project generates realistic faces. It should be obvious that generated sample images look like faces
      - How could your model improve?
        - The question about model improvement is answered
